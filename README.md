## Background
In this project I collected data by webscraping Craigslist using the BeautifulSoup package. The data was collected on March 2020 and contains information for postings from 3 months prior. The goal of this project was to analyze the apartment postings to find which locations in the the Bay Area were the more beneficial to live in based on multiple variables. I'm originally from the Peninsula area so I wanted to know more about the other areas.
